            I'm a dedicated and aspiring Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building responsive, full-stack applications using the MERN stack & Spring Boot. I enjoy transforming ideas into real-world applications that solve problems and deliver seamless user experiences.
          </p>
          <p className={`text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 ${isVisible ? "slide-up delay-200" : "opacity-0"}`}>
            My journey began during my B.Tech in Computer Science at Parul University, where I immersed myself in development and data structures. From developing a text-to-image generator (PixelVerse) to completing real-world simulations with companies like Tata Group, I've consistently pushed myself to learn and implement cutting-edge technologies.
          </p>
          <p className={`text-lg text-muted-foreground ${isVisible ? "slide-up delay-300" : "opacity-0"}`}>
            Outside of code, I enjoy participating in tech hackathons, and sharpening my DSA skills â€” having solved 500+ problems on platforms like LeetCode and GFG. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always looking for opportunities to grow, contribute, and innovate.
